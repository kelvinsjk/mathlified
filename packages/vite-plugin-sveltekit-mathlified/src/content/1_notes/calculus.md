## Creating content in Mathlified

The `src/content` folder is where our content lives. In particular, the source
code for this page is located at `/1_notes/calculus.md` within the content folder.

If you're new to Mathlified, we recommend having both the source code and the
web page open at the same time. Notice this file ends with `.md` file extension.
This is the Markdown language/format that we can author content in.

If you're new to this format, we will highlight the features of the Markdown
language progressively in the subsequent pages. Try to find the places where the
mentioned syntax is used in the source code. A quick reference of the syntax is
located on [Commonmark](https://commonmark.org/help/).

### Markdown features used in these notes

- The `#` character creates headings, with the number of `#` indicating the
  depth of the heading.
- Links can be created using the `[text](url)` format.
- "Automatic" links (links with the same text and url) are created using the
  `<url>` format.
- A horizontal rule can be created using `---`.
- Unordered ("bulleted") lists can be created using the `-` character.

### Page title

The title of this page is derived from its file name, with its first letter
capitalized and any dashes converted to spaces. This will be the default
behavior.

## About Calculus Volume 1

Calculus is designed for the typical two- or three-semester general calculus
course, incorporating innovative features to enhance student learning. The book
guides students through the core concepts of calculus and helps them understand
how those concepts apply to their lives and the world around them. Due to the
comprehensive nature of the material, we are offering the book in three volumes
for flexibility and efficiency. Volume 1 covers functions, limits, derivatives,
and integration. Coverage and scope

Our Calculus Volume 1 textbook adheres to the scope and sequence of most general
calculus courses nationwide. We have worked to make calculus interesting and
accessible to students while maintaining the mathematical rigor inherent in the
subject. With this objective in mind, the content of the three volumes of
Calculus have been developed and arranged to provide a logical progression from
fundamental to more advanced concepts, building upon what students have already
learned and emphasizing connections between topics and between theory and
applications. The goal of each section is to enable students not just to
recognize concepts, but work with them in ways that will be useful in later
courses and future careers. The organization and pedagogical features were
developed and vetted with feedback from mathematics educators dedicated to the
project.
