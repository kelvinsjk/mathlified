## What is Mathlified?

Mathlified is a framework for authoring (mathematical) content. We help you create a website that works great at small and large screen sizes while you focus on the content. With a bit of setup you will also be able to get high quality LaTeX pdfs from the same source material.

- **Built on excellence**: We leverage the power of top-tier technologies like Vite and SvelteKit.
- **Highly extensible**: Mathlified aims to provide good defaults to get you started in no time. When you're ready to take things to the next level, it can also be extended to tailor to your needs.
- **Free and open source**: Mathlified is free to use, modify, and distribute under the permissive MIT license.

## Getting started

If you're new, the fastest way to get up and running is via GitHub, StackBlitz and Vercel.

## Demo and tutorial

The content in this demo and tutorial site is arranged sequentially to help you learn how to use Mathlified. Each page will discuss some of the features of the framework, and showcase a demo of how to use them.

1. The [Notes](/notes/calculus) section will guide you through authoring content in Mathlified.
2. The [Questions](/questions/elementary-algebra-2e) section will introduce the Mathlifier and Mathlify libraries that can help the authoring experience in JavaScript.
3. The [Printouts](xxx) section will guide you through setup on your own local machine. This unlocks the option to get LaTeX pdfs from the same source we have already been working on.
4. The [Quiz](quizXXX) section will show how we can customize website functionality.
5. The [Exams](/exams/XXX) section will cover customizing the creation of LaTeX pdfs.
