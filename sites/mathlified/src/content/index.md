# Overview

Mathlified is a framework for authoring (mathematical) content.

$$ \text{e}^{\text{i}\pi} = -1 $$

While you focus on the content, Mathlified does the work in the background
to generate a responsive website/webapp. It can also generate high quality
$\LaTeX$ pdfs from the same source material.

This website serves both as a starting template as well as a
demo and tutorial on how to use Mathlified.
