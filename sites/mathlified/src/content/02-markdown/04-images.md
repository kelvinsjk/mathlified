# Images

We use the Markdown `![alt text](url)` notation to insert images.

## Pdf compatibility

To enable cross-platform compatibility between the web and pdf, ensure
all local images are placed in the `static` folder in the base project
directory. We then start our url with `/` and point to the image.

## Exercise

### Add images

You can also link to images hosted online. Try that out!

### Image in pdf

Now modify this file to generate a pdf. Add more images into the
`static` folder and display them on the page/pdf.
