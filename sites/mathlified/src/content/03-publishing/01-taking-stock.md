# Taking stock

The core Markdown/Djot functionality of Mathlified is sufficient to
get a very functional site up and running.

We think that static sites like course websites, documentation and
blogs can be created with what we have outlined.

All that's left to do is to [put it on the web](./publishing).

## Advanced Mathlified

The rest of the tutorial covers advanced use-cases of Mathlified, and
can be done "choose your own adventure" style.

### Custom pages

The custom pages chapter deals with cases where we want to add pages
to the site that aren't well expressed by static Markdown/djot.

Examples include more app-like features such as interactive content.

We will need knowledge of JavaScript and Svelte for this chapter.

### Custom pdfs

Mathlified can also create custom pdfs for non Markdown/djot content,
further extending the "write once, run anywhere" ethos of Mathlified.

We will need knowledge of JavaScript and either $\LaTeX$ or djot for
this chapter.

### Under the hood

To fully customize the look and functionality (eg sidebar navigation),
we will also look at the inner workings of Mathlified to tweak the
relevant sections to our needs.

We will need knowledge of SvelteKit for this chapter.
