### New Markdown notation

In this page, we use the following features:

- To insert images, we use `![alt text](url)` notation. The image should be placed in the `static`
  folder in the base project directory, and the `url` should point to the image.
- Tables are produced using `|`. We align the items centrally using `:---:`.

## Linear Functions and Slope

The easiest type of function to consider is a linear function. Linear functions have the form
$f(x)=ax+b$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants. In the figure below, we see examples of linear
functions when a is positive, negative, and zero. Note that if $a>0$, the graph of the line rises as
$x$ increases. In other words, $f(x)=ax+b$ is increasing on $(-\infty, \infty)$. If $a<0$, the graph
of the line falls as $x$ increases. In this case, $f(x)=ax+b$ is decreasing on $(-\infty, \infty)$.
If $a=0$, the line is horizontal.

## Transformations of functions

We can summarize the different transformations and their related effects on the graph of a function
in the following table.

| Transformation of $f (c>0)$ |  Effect on the graph of $f$   |
| :-------------------------: | :---------------------------: |
|          $f(x)+c$           |  Vertical shift up $c$ units  |
|          $f(x)-c$           | Vertical shift down $c$ units |
|          $f(x+c)$           |    Shift left by $c$ units    |
|          $f(x-c)$           |   Shift right by $c$ units    |
|           $cf(x)$           |   Vertical stretch if c > 1   |
