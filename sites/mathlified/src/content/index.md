# Overview

Mathlified is a framework for authoring (mathematical) content.

$$ \text{e}^{\text{i}\pi} = -1 $$

## Why Mathlified

### Mathematics on the web

Mathlified helps you put mathematical content on the web.

With the ubiquity of smartphones, we believe the web is the place to host mathematical content of the next generation.

### LaTeX pdfs from the same source

Mathlified can also generate high quality pdfs from the same source material. No more rewriting or copying and pasting to get the same content on different mediums!

### Free and open source

Mathlified is free to use, modify, and distribute under the permissive MIT license, and built on top of other high-quality open source projects like [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [temml](https://temml.org/).
